# Collision-Warning-System ( Dashcam-Based AI ALert)
This is a AI projects that aims to warn drivers about potential collisions using dashcam video analysis.
#Objective:
To build a real-time collision alert system that analyzes dashcam footage and gives warnings like:
-"Car CLose"
-> "Truck Close"
-> "Bus Close"
-> "Warning: Pedestrain/Bicycle"
These alerts help drivers stay cautious in complex traffic conditions.

---
#Designed For:
-Dashcam mounted on car windshieled
-Works even when car bonnet is partially visible
-Tested in "rainy weather conditions to improve robustness
---

#Tech Stack:
-Python
-OpenCV
-YOLOv5(pretrained model for object detection
-Real-time frame wise video analysis

#Current Features:
- Detect vehicles and humans from dashcam video
- Warns based on object type and proximity
- Displays alerts dynamically on the video frame
- Capable of running in moderate weather interference e.g rain
- Supports videos with bonnet partially in frame

- -

#Work in Progess:
- Improving false-positive filtering using confidence level threshold and bounding box logic
- Adding distance estimation for more accurate warnings
- Planning to integrate audio alerts
- UI/UX polish and documentation underway
Preparing a collision warning system for vehicles

###Note:
this project is being improved regularly by experiementing with differentdetection strategiesand edge cases.
